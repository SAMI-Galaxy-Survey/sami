Functions to calculate the:
1) drizzle overlap between a square and a circle (function `resample_circle`
   by Jon Nielsen 2012)
2) Gaussian overlap between a circular Gaussian and a square grid (function
   `inteGrauss2d` by Francesco D'Eugenio 2017)

These calculations are the crucial step in drizzling, to know how much each
input fibre (circle) contributes to each output spaxel (square).

In general this code isn't actually used, as there is a C++ version that
is significantly faster. The functions here are provided as a fall-back in
case the C++ version hasn't been compiled.

WARNING by Francesco D'Eugenio 16/02/2017
The original drizzle overlap as it is implemented in Python has a
severe bug, in that if the circle falls partially outside the grid, the
weights are ``wrapped around`` and distributed to the opposide side of the
grid, as illustrated below.

Because of this bug that I do not have time to address, every time you load
the pipeline and use this implementation (as opposed to the C++ implementation)
you will receive a horrible warning. You're welcome.

    Written by Jon Nielsen 2012
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    xpix: (int) Number of pixels in the x-dimension of the output grid
    ypix: (int) Number of pixels in the y-dimension of the output grid
    xc: (float) x-position of the centre of the circle.
    yc: (float) y-position of the centre of the circle.
    r: (float) radius of the circle
    args: any additional arguments. This is ignored in the context of this
        function (its purpose is to gather additional arguments that may be
        passed to equivalent functions with a different signature).
    
    Output
    ------
    2D array of floats. A weight map for the intersection of a circle with
    a square grid. Squares on the grid that are completely within the circle
    receive a weight of 1. Square that intersect the circle are given a weight
    that is proportional to the area of the square inside the circle.

    Notes
    -----

    The zeroth axis of the output array is for the y-dimension and the
    first axis is for the x-dimension. i.e., out.shape -> (ypix, xpix)
    This can be VERY CONFUSING, particularly when one remembers that imshow's
    behaviour is to plot the zeroth axis as the vertical coordinate and the first
    axis as the horizontal coordinate.
